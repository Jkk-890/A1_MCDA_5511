To get the code to run you must

1. Run "uv sync"
2. Select the python "3.10.16" kernal
3. Run .venv\Scripts\Activate
4. Run .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ensurepip --upgrade
5. Run .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install ipykernel

After completing these steps the code should run fine

Notes: 
1. If you are on Mac you probably need to switch every '\' to a '/'.
